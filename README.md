# Simple Themeable

A [docsify.js](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify) plugin to simplify the color selection for [docsify-themeable](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable).

## Installation and usage instructions

> [!NOTE]
> Sorry for not providing a demo, but I thought this is a very self explanatory setup. But I am using this activly in [another projects](https://github.com/Karlo-Hosting/Docs/blob/a42df71978a439923162b411b2efb589df0a8e22/_css/colors-dark.css#L1).

How to install this plugin:

1. Make sure you have [docsify-themeable](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable) installed.
2. Copy one of the stylesheet segments from below and copy it into the `head` section your `index.html` file. Make sure that is is after all other plugins and before your own modifications.
3. Copy the color-files from [the example directory](https://github.com/FlippedCodes/docsify-simple-themeable/tree/main/example) into your projects `_css/` folder.
4. Change the colors in those files to your liking.

### Production

For production, please use the numbered version to prevent breaking changes in production.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" href="./_css/colors-dark.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" href="./_css/colors-light.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/docsify-simple-themeable@1.0.5/dist/main.min.css">
```

### Development

If you are developing on a doc, you can use the latest. Make sure you switch it to production later, or the production one right away.

``` html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" href="./_css/colors-dark.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" href="./_css/colors-light.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/docsify-simple-themeable@latest/dist/main.min.css">
```

## Tips

- This project is inspired by the color pallet naming scheme of [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): You can use their [theme generator](https://v4.daisyui.com/theme-generator/) to select colors.
- If you think something on your docs should have a different color. You are more then welcome to copy the `src/main.css` into your `_css` folder as well. Just make sure you don't forget to adjust hte link in in the `head` section of your `index.html`!
- If you already have a css files, you are free to change the folder location in the stylesheet references in `index.html`.
- If you need additional fixes, feel free to copy my css file from [this repo]([_css/fixes.css](https://github.com/FlippedCodes/Anything-Computer-Docs/blob/main/_css/fixes.css)).

Thanks to the [docsify.js](https://docsify.js.org/#/) team to make changing CSS so simple. I usually don't front end, but this was a breeze to get working.
